signal_generator:
  length: 256
  method: 
    name: sinusoids
    frequencies: [32]
    amplitudes: [1]
    phases: [0]
    chirp_rate: 0
  noise:
    type: "gaussian"
    correlation: 0
    variance: 0.027777777777777776 # (0.25*2/3)^2 so +- 3sd is 0.5 which is 1/4 the magnitude of the signal (-1 to 1)
